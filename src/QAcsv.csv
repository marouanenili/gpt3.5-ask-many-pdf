The contract shall specify separate fixed hourly rates that include wages, overhead, general and administrative expenses, and profit for each category of labor. A time-and-materials contract or order may be used only if the contracting officer prepares a determination and findings that no other contract type is suitable and the contract or order includes a ceiling price that the contractor exceeds at its own risk.
